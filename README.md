## Running the Application Locally

Application can be run with [SimpleBankingBackendApplication][simple-banking-backend-main-class] class.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Gradle plugin][spring-boot-gradle-plugin] like so:

```shell
gradle clean build
gradle bootRun
```

## Running the Application in Docker

Application can be run in Docker. [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in the project root folder is the configuration file for Docker build.

```shell
docker build -t simple-banking-backend:1.0.0 --build-arg APP_JAR=simple-banking-backend-1.0.0.jar .
docker run -p 8081:8081 --name SimpleBankingBackend simple-banking-backend:1.0.0
```
Note that you can specify the name of the APP_JAR argument based on the jar file that is generated by gradle. If the argument is not provided, it will pick the default name specified in the Dockerfile.

## Run Actuator

[Spring Boot Actuator][spring-boot-actuator] can be reached from [local url for Actuator][local-actuator].

Only health and caches endpoints are enabled by default. Configuration can be updated within the "actuator" section of the related application.properties file.

## Run Swagger UI
[Swagger UI][swagger-ui] can be reached from [local url for Swagger UI][local-swagger-ui] and [production url for Swagger UI][production-swagger-ui].

## Run RabbitMQ
[RabbitMQ][rabbit-mq] is used for messaging between services. It can be run with the following command after getting the image from Docker Hub;

```shell
docker run --name simple-banking-rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3.12-management
```

RabbitMQ management console can be reached from [local URL for RabbitMQ management console][local-rabbit-mq-management-console-url]. Default username and password are "guest".

You need to create a new queue from "Queues and Streams" from RabbitMQ management console.
